Below is a README file designed to guide users on how to set up and run the "erc20-midterm" project from the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/koezyrs/erc20-midterm`. This README assumes the project is an ERC20 token implementation written in Solidity, using Hardhat as the development frameworkâ€”a common choice for Ethereum smart contract projects. Adjust the instructions if the repository uses a different framework (e.g., Truffle) or includes additional components like a frontend.

# ERC20 Midterm Project

This repository contains the implementation of an ERC20 token as part of a midterm project. The token is written in Solidity and is designed to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

### Custom ERC20 Token

- Standard ERC20 functionality (transfer, balanceOf, etc.)
- Custom transfer implementation with a small fee

### Staking and Reward System

- **Staking**: Users can lock up their tokens to earn rewards over time
- **Unstaking**: Users can withdraw their staked tokens at any time
- **Rewards**: Stakers earn additional tokens automatically based on their staked amount and time
- **Reward Claiming**: Accumulated rewards can be claimed and received as newly minted tokens

#### How Staking Works

1. Users stake tokens by calling the `stake(amount)` function
2. The staked tokens are transferred from the user's wallet to the contract
3. Every 10 seconds, rewards accumulate based on the formula:
   - `reward = (staked amount * reward rate * time) / (period * 1000)`
   - With default settings, this gives approximately 10% reward over time
4. Users can claim rewards at any time through the `claimRewards()` function
5. Unstaking is possible with the `unstake(amount)` function, which returns tokens to the user's wallet

#### Owner Controls

- The contract owner can adjust the transfer fee (max 1%)
- The reward rate can be modified by the owner (max 50%)

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (version 14.x or higher)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (comes with Node.js)
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**

You will also need a local Ethereum blockchain for development, such as **[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)**, or access to an Ethereum testnet.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koezyrs/erc20-midterm.git
cd erc20-midterm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively, if the project uses Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Compile the Smart Contracts

Compile the Solidity contracts using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

This will generate the contract artifacts needed for deployment.

### 4. Run a Local Blockchain

Start a local Ethereum blockchain using Hardhat's built-in network:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This command will launch a local Ethereum node with pre-funded accounts. Keep this terminal running in the background.

Alternatively, you can use Ganache or another local blockchain tool if preferred.

### 5. Deploy the Contracts

Deploy the contracts to the local network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

> **Note**: The deployment script may have a different name (e.g., `deploy.js`). Check the `scripts/` folder in the repository for the correct file name.

After deployment, the terminal will display the contract address. Save this address for interacting with the token.

### 6. Interact with the Contract

Use the Hardhat console to interact with the deployed contract:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

### 7. Interact with the Web

Open app.js and replace the `contractAddress` with your contract address.

After that, run index.html with LiveServer.

## Using the Staking Features

### In the Web Interface

1. **Connect your wallet**: Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect MetaMask
2. **View your balance**: Check your token balance in the dashboard
3. **Stake tokens**: Enter an amount and click "Stake" to start earning rewards
4. **Monitor rewards**: Watch your pending rewards accumulate in real-time
5. **Claim rewards**: Click "Claim Rewards" to receive your earned tokens
6. **Unstake**: Withdraw your staked tokens by clicking "Unstake" and entering an amount

### Using Contract Directly

You can interact with the staking functions directly through the contract:

```javascript
// Stake tokens
await contract.stake(ethers.utils.parseUnits("100", 18));

// Check staking information
const [amount, timestamp, pendingRewards] = await contract.getStakeInfo(
  userAddress
);

// Claim rewards
await contract.claimRewards();

// Unstake tokens
await contract.unstake(ethers.utils.parseUnits("50", 18));
```

This README provides a clear, step-by-step guide to set up and run the "erc20-midterm" project. It assumes a Hardhat-based workflow, which is typical for modern Ethereum development, but you should verify the repository's structure and adjust the instructions accordingly if it uses a different framework or additional features (e.g., a frontend).
